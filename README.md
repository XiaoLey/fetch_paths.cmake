# fetch_paths.cmake

[[ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ ä¸­æ–‡]](README_zh.md)

## Introduction

`fetch_paths()` is a flexible and powerful custom CMake function designed to search directories and extract file or subdirectory paths. With a rich set of filtering options based on regular expressions, you can easily configure the starting directory, specify the base for relative paths, and apply both inclusion and exclusion filters. Whether you need recursive traversal or a one-level search, and whether you want to merge new results with existing ones or replace them entirely, `fetch_paths()` streamlines file and directory management during your build process.

## Function Prototype

```cmake
fetch_paths(<output_var>
            [RELATIVE_PATH <relative_path>]
            [WORKING_DIRECTORY <directory>]
            [OUTPUT_FILTER_LIST <regex> ...]
            [EXCLUDE_FILTER_LIST <regex> ...]
            [EXCLUDE_LIST_VAR <var>]
            [EXCLUDE_LIST_FILTER_LIST <regex> ...]
            [APPEND]
            [DISABLE_RECURSION]
            [DIRECTORY])
```

## Parameter Explanation

| Parameter Name                         | Description                                                  |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output_var`                           | Mandatory. This variable will store the list of paths (files or directories) identified by the search. |
| `RELATIVE_PATH <relative_path>`        | Defines the base directory to which the output paths will be made relative. If not specified, paths default to being relative to `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`. |
| `WORKING_DIRECTORY <directory>`        | Specifies the directory where the search begins. This can be provided as a relative path (based on `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`). If omitted, it defaults to `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`. |
| `OUTPUT_FILTER_LIST <regex> ...`       | **A list of regular expressions** used to filter the output results. Only paths matching at least one of these patterns are kept. By default, this is set to `.+\.(c|cpp|cc|cxx)$` for files, or `.*` when the `DIRECTORY` option is enabled. |
| `EXCLUDE_FILTER_LIST <regex> ...`      | **A list of regular expressions** defining patterns for paths to exclude. These filters are applied after the output filters, removing any paths that match the specified patterns. |
| `EXCLUDE_LIST_VAR <var>`               | Specifies a variable name where paths that do not meet the filter criteria are stored. If no `EXCLUDE_FILTER_LIST` is provided, this variable remains empty. |
| `EXCLUDE_LIST_FILTER_LIST <regex> ...` | Applies additional filtering to the paths collected in `EXCLUDE_LIST_VAR`, only retaining those that match the provided regular expressions. **Note that this filter does not affect the main output variable.** |
| `APPEND`                               | Enables append mode. When set, newly found paths will be added to the existing content of `output_var` rather than replacing it. |
| `DISABLE_RECURSION`                    | Disables recursive search, so the function will only search within the specified working directory without descending into subdirectories. |
| `DIRECTORY`                            | Indicates that the function should retrieve directory paths **instead of file paths**. When used, the default **output filter** automatically changes to `.*`. |

## Examples

- Retrieve the relative paths of all C/C++ source files in the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` directory.

  ```cmake
  fetch_paths(output_files)
  ```

- Retrieve the relative paths of all C/C++ source files in the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` directory, but do not search subdirectories.

  ```cmake
  fetch_paths(output_files DISABLE_RECURSION)
  ```

- Retrieve the paths of all C/C++ source files in the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` directory relative to `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`.

  ```cmake
  fetch_paths(output_files RELATIVE_PATH ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR})
  ```

- Retrieve the paths of all C/C++ source files in the `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` directory relative to `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`.

  ```cmake
  fetch_paths(output_files WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR})
  ```

- Retrieve the relative paths of all files involved in Qt compilation in the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` directory.

  ```cmake
  fetch_paths(output_files OUTPUT_FILTER_LIST ".+\\.ui$" ".+\\.qrc$" ".+\\.(c|cpp|cc|cxx)$" ".+\\.h$")
  ```

- Retrieve all directory paths in the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` directory.

  ```cmake
  fetch_paths(output_dirs DIRECTORY)
  ```

- Retrieve all directory paths in the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` directory relative to the system root directory.

  ```cmake
  # Linux
  fetch_paths(output_dirs DIRECTORY RELATIVE_PATH "/")
  # Windows
  fetch_paths(output_dirs DIRECTORY RELATIVE_PATH "C:/")
  ```

- Retrieve the relative paths of all files and directories in the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` directory.

  ```cmake
  fetch_paths(output OUTPUT_FILTER_LIST ".*")
  fetch_paths(output DIRECTORY APPEND)
  ```
